### Restful API

> Representational State Transfer (RESTï¼‰
RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. [What is RESTful API? AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/)
RESTful means they follow a set of rules or constraints known as a representational state transfer, which has been the de facto standard for API development since the early 2000s.

 These are resources into a bunch of unique [URI or uniform resource]() identifiers that differentiate different types of data resources on a server and a client can get by the data by making a request to that endpoint over [HTTP requests](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-kinds-of-http-requests/).
