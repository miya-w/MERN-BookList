### What is API
 > An application programming interface (API) [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/)

API is applications programming interface. it's a way for two computers to talk to each other.
for example, It's just like using a website in your browser to explicitly request data from a server.

### Restful API

> Representational State Transfer (REST）
RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet. Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. [What is RESTful API? AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/)

RESTful means they follow a set of rules or constraints known as a representational state transfer, which has been the de facto standard for API development since the early 2000s.

These are resources into a bunch of unique [URI or uniform resource]() identifiers that differentiate different types of data resources on a server and a client can get by the data by making a request to that endpoint over [HTTP requests](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/different-kinds-of-http-requests/).
